## 1) Project Description

**SLAM-Seq_Analysis** is a modular, high-throughput Snakemake pipeline designed to analyze **SLAM-Seq** data. It quantifies RNA synthesis and degradation by detecting **T>C transitions**. This pipeline processes raw **paired-end FASTQ** files through quality control, UMI extraction, adapter trimming, alignment, mutation counting, and context-specific mutation analysis using **SLAM-Dunk** and **Alleyoop**. The final output includes BAM files, CSVs, summary files, and MultiQC reports.

It supports both **default 1-TC** and **custom 2-TC** read count thresholds for downstream comparative analysis and includes fully automated **MultiQC** reports for raw, trimmed, and SLAM-Dunk outputs. Additionally, the pipeline optionally supports a **spike-in genome** (e.g., S. pombe), allowing for parallel alignment and mutation quantification for normalization and QC purposes. Spike-in analysis is controlled by the flag `use_spikein` in the `config.yml` and produces a parallel set of filtered BAMs, mutation calls, and summary reports in a separate output directory `results/slamdunk_spikein`.  

### Key Features  

+ **UMI Support**  
  + Extracts UMIs using `fastp`, allowing for duplicate-aware alignment and quantification  

+ **Multiple Adapter Trimming Methods Set in `config.yml` (optional)**  
  + Choose between **Trim Galore** or **BBduk**  
  + `use_trim_galore`: toggle between BBduk and Trim Galore  

+ **Comprehensive QC Reports**  
  + FastQC on raw and trimmed reads  
  + MultiQC reports summarize results in unified HTML  

+ **Spike-In Genome Support in `config.yml` (optional)**  
  + `use_spikein`: toggle between true/false to enable/disable spike-in genome alignment  
  + `spikein_genome`, `spikein_bed`: reference FASTA and BED for spike-in genome  
  + Generates its own BAMs, tcount files, and QC reports  

+ **SLAM-Dunk Integration**  
  + `slam-dunk all`: Align, filter, SNP call, and count  
  + `slam-dunk count`: Rerun mutation quantification with 2-TC threshold  

+ **Alleyoop Analysis**  
  + Generates mutation rates, context, UTR rates, SNP evaluation  
  + Summarizes and merges mutation counts across samples  
  + Outputs T>C mutation information per read and UTR position  

+ **Scalable and Reproducible**  
  + Parallelizable via Snakemake  
  + Designed for Slurm HPC environments  

---

## 2) Intended Use Case

This pipeline is built for researchers analyzing **RNA turnover** via **SLAM-seq**, especially when interested in:  

+ Mutation counts (T>C transitions) per gene or region  
+ Comparing samples using 1-TC vs. 2-TC thresholds  
+ Producing summary metrics and mutation contexts  
+ Running in a reproducible and modular HPC environment  
+ Supports optional spike-in controls (e.g., *S. pombe*) to facilitate normalization across samples or conditions.  

Starting from raw paired-end FASTQs, it provides all necessary intermediate and final outputs, from filtered BAMs to mutation summaries and log diagnostics.

## 5) Example Data

A minimal test dataset can be placed in a `resources/` folder (not included currently). Update `samples.csv` to point to these FASTQs for a quick test run. Once confirmed, replace with your personal SLAM-seq data.

## 6) Explanation of `samples.csv`

`config/samples.csv` defines which FASTQ files to process, what the naming convention will be, and which samples to create average signal tracks. An example `samples.csv` is provided below:
